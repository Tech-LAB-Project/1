# Tech-LAB_1

## A Simulated Network Training Environment


Tech-LAB is a Work Project that we have been working on.
Our Goal is to simulate a Network-Environment using:

- Raspberry Pi
- USB Wifi Adapter
- USB Network Switch
- And some miscellaneous Parts

This Simulated Network-Environment can be used for Penetration Testing, Cyber-Security Research and Ethical Hacking Demos.

All Options are available over the Web-Gui (URL = IP of Pi)

We will be testing the Environment with the Top 10 OWASP Security Risks.

## Parts List

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB Model B)
- 2.4" TFT LCD
- TP-Link TL-WN722N V3.0
- StarTech USB Extension (15 cm)
- Random 64GB SD Card
- Renkforce 5 Port Ethernet Switch
- OKdo Raspby Case

In Total we spent around 150$ USD for our Tech-LAB.

You can also run the Software on other Raspberry Pi's such as B+ or Pi 3.
